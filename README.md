# monetization
Monetization and accelerometer prototype

Simple prototype for mobile platform. Please, open the project in Corona SDK for test (SDK doesn't support all functions of accelerometer and monetization systems. Build the project to the Android or iOS)

If you'd like to work with "*.lua"* files - try "ZeroBrane Studio" and choose the "corona interpreter".
